<h2 id="privacy-first-zero-knowledge-protection">Privacy First: Zero-Knowledge Protection</h2>
<p><strong>LeafLock is fundamentally different from most online services.</strong> We’ve built our application with zero-knowledge architecture, which means <strong>we cannot read your notes even if we wanted to</strong>. Your data is encrypted on your device before it ever reaches our servers, and only you have the keys.</p>
<p>This unique approach means that many traditional data protection concerns simply don’t apply to LeafLock - because we never see your sensitive information in the first place.</p>
<h2 id="what-this-means-for-you">What This Means for You</h2>
<p>✅ <strong>Your notes are completely private</strong> - We cannot access, read, or analyze your note content<br/>
✅ <strong>No data mining</strong> - We can’t build profiles or sell your information because we don’t have it<br/>
✅ <strong>Breach protection</strong> - Even if our servers were compromised, your notes remain encrypted<br/>
✅ <strong>Government requests</strong> - We literally cannot hand over your note content to anyone</p>
<h2 id="your-gdpr-rights">Your GDPR Rights</h2>
<p>As a LeafLock user in the EU, you have the following rights:</p>
<h3 id="-right-to-know-what-data-we-have">🔍 Right to Know What Data We Have</h3>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> You can ask us what personal information we’ve collected about you.<br/>
<strong>At LeafLock:</strong> We only have your email address, account metadata, and usage logs. Your actual notes? We can’t access them, so we can’t tell you what’s in them (because we don’t know).</p>
<h3 id="-right-to-access-your-data">📋 Right to Access Your Data</h3>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> You can get a copy of all your personal data.<br/>
<strong>At LeafLock:</strong> We can provide your account information and usage patterns, but your notes are encrypted with your keys, so only you can decrypt them.</p>
<h3 id="️-right-to-correct-information">✏️ Right to Correct Information</h3>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> You can ask us to fix any wrong information.<br/>
<strong>At LeafLock:</strong> You can update your email address through your account settings. Since we don’t see your note content, there’s nothing there for us to correct.</p>
<h3 id="️-right-to-be-forgotten">🗑️ Right to Be Forgotten</h3>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> You can ask us to delete your personal data.<br/>
<strong>At LeafLock:</strong> Simply delete your account, and we’ll remove all your data within 30 days. This includes your encrypted notes (which we couldn’t read anyway).</p>
<h3 id="️-right-to-limit-processing">⏸️ Right to Limit Processing</h3>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> You can ask us to stop using your data in certain ways.<br/>
<strong>At LeafLock:</strong> Contact us if you want to temporarily suspend your account while keeping your data.</p>
<h3 id="-right-to-data-portability">📦 Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> You can get your data in a format to move to another service.<br/>
<strong>At LeafLock:</strong> You can export your notes anytime from within the app. Since they’re encrypted locally, you have full control over your data.</p>
<h3 id="-right-to-object">🚫 Right to Object</h3>
<p><strong>What this means:</strong> You can object to how we process your data.<br/>
<strong>At LeafLock:</strong> We don’t do marketing or profiling since we can’t see your content. You can object to our minimal usage analytics if needed.</p>
<h2 id="what-data-we-actually-collect">What Data We Actually Collect</h2>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3 id="-can-you-really-not-see-my-notes">❓ “Can you really not see my notes?”</h3>
<p><strong>No, we genuinely cannot.</strong> Your notes are encrypted with keys that only exist on your devices. Even our engineers with full server access cannot decrypt your content.</p>
<h3 id="-what-if-i-lose-my-password">❓ “What if I lose my password?”</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, if you lose your password, we cannot recover your notes because we don’t have the encryption keys. This is the trade-off for true privacy.</p>
<h3 id="-do-you-share-data-with-third-parties">❓ “Do you share data with third parties?”</h3>
<p>We don’t share your data with advertisers, data brokers, or analytics companies. The only exception would be if legally required (but remember, we can’t share your note content because we can’t access it).</p>
<h3 id="-how-do-i-know-youre-not-lying-about-encryption">❓ “How do I know you’re not lying about encryption?”</h3>
<p>Our code is open source on GitHub. Security researchers can audit our encryption implementation to verify our claims.</p>
<h3 id="-what-happens-to-my-data-if-leaflock-shuts-down">❓ “What happens to my data if LeafLock shuts down?”</h3>
<p>You can export all your notes anytime since they’re encrypted locally. If we ever shut down, we’d give users advance notice to export their data.</p>
