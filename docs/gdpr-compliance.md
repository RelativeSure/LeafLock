## How We Process Your Data

### Lawful Basis for Processing
We process your personal data based on:
- **Explicit consent**: When you create an account and agree to our terms
- **Contractual necessity**: To provide the secure notes service you've signed up for
- **Legitimate interest**: For security monitoring, fraud prevention, and service improvement

### Data We Collect
We only collect data necessary to provide our service:
- **Account information**: Email address and encrypted authentication data
- **Usage data**: Service logs and metrics for security and performance
- **Communication**: Support messages and feedback you send us

### Zero-Knowledge Privacy
LeafLock is designed with privacy by design:
- Your notes are encrypted on your device before reaching our servers
- We cannot read your notes due to our zero-knowledge architecture
- Only you have the keys to decrypt your data

## Exercising Your Rights

### How to Make a Request
To exercise any of your GDPR rights, contact us at `contact@leaflock.app` with:
- Your account email address
- The specific right you want to exercise
- Any additional information to help us verify your identity

### Response Timeline
We will respond to your request within one month of receiving it. For complex requests,
we may extend this by up to two additional months and will notify you if this is necessary.

### No Cost
Exercising your GDPR rights is free of charge, unless your request is manifestly
unfounded or excessive.

## Data Protection Measures

### Organizational Measures
- **Data minimization**: We only collect necessary data
- **Retention limits**: Data is deleted when no longer needed

- **Support communications**: 3 years for quality and legal purposes
- **Deleted accounts**: Permanently deleted within 30 days

## International Data Transfers

If your data is transferred outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we ensure
adequate protection through:
- **Adequacy decisions**: Transferring to countries deemed adequate by the EU
- **Standard Contractual Clauses**: Legal agreements ensuring GDPR-level protection
- **Appropriate safeguards**: Additional security measures as required

## Data Breach Notification

In the event of a personal data breach:
