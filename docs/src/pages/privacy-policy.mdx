This Privacy Policy describes how LeafLock collects, uses, and safeguards information
when you access the LeafLock platform or documentation. Operators of self-hosted
instances should adapt this policy to reflect their deployment specifics.

## Information We Collect
- **Account Information:** Name, email address, and authentication data provided when
  creating or managing an account.
- **Usage Data:** Logs, metrics, and device information required for service reliability
  and security.
- **Support Communications:** Messages you send to `support@leaflock.app`, including
  attachments and metadata needed to resolve issues.

LeafLock does not intentionally collect special categories of personal data. Operators
must configure custom fields to avoid storing sensitive information unless obligated by
law and protected by appropriate safeguards.

## How We Use Information
We process data to:
- Provide and maintain platform functionality.
- Detect, prevent, and respond to security incidents.
- Communicate updates, maintenance notifications, and policy changes.
- Generate aggregated, anonymised analytics to improve performance.

## Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell personal data. We may share data with:
- Service providers offering infrastructure, analytics, or email delivery under binding
  agreements and confidentiality obligations.
- Law enforcement or government authorities when required by applicable law.
- Successors in the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, subject to this Policy.

## Data Retention
Data is retained only as long as necessary for the purposes described above or to comply
with legal obligations. Users may request deletion of their personal data by contacting
`contact@leaflock.app`.

## International Transfers
Where data is transferred outside the region of collection, LeafLock implements
appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses or adequacy decisions.

## Your Rights
Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or
restrict processing of your personal data, and to object to certain processing activities.
Submit requests to `contact@leaflock.app`.

## Children
LeafLock is not directed to children under the age of 16. If we learn that personal data
from a child has been collected without verifiable parental consent, we will delete it.

## Changes to this Policy
We will post updates to this document and, where appropriate, notify you via email or in
app. Material changes take effect no sooner than 14 days after notice unless required by
law.
