## Overview

This secure notes application is designed with end-to-end encryption where each user manages their own encrypted workspace. This guide explains how to manage users, configure admin access, and maintain the system while respecting the zero-knowledge architecture.

## Current System Architecture

The application uses:
- **Zero-knowledge encryption**: Server never sees plaintext data
- **User workspaces**: Each user has their own encrypted workspace
- **Note-level permissions**: Users can share notes with `read`, `write`, or `admin` permissions
- **PostgreSQL database**: User data stored in encrypted format

## Admin Access Setup

### Grant Admin Access (Development)

1. **Get your user ID (UUID)**:
   - Log in, then open browser DevTools → Application → Local Storage → find `current_user_id`
   - Or decode the JWT stored in `secure_token`:
     ```javascript
     JSON.parse(atob(localStorage.getItem('secure_token').split('.')[1])).user_id
     ```

2. **Add to environment variables**:
   - Add your UUID to `.env`: `ADMIN_USER_IDS=<your-uuid-here>`
   - Multiple admins: `ADMIN_USER_IDS=<uuid-1>,<uuid-2>`

3. **Restart the application**:
   ```bash
   make down && make up
   ```

### Database Admin Management

#### Add Admin Column (One-time Setup)

```sql
-- Connect to PostgreSQL database
psql -U postgres -d notes

-- Add admin role column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN is_admin BOOLEAN DEFAULT false;

-- Create index for faster admin queries
CREATE INDEX idx_users_is_admin ON users(is_admin);
```

#### Make User Admin

```sql
-- Grant admin access by email
UPDATE users
SET is_admin = true
WHERE email = 'admin@example.com';

-- Or by user ID
UPDATE users
SET is_admin = true
WHERE id = 'your-user-uuid-here';
```

#### Remove Admin Access

```sql
-- Revoke admin access
UPDATE users
SET is_admin = false
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

## Admin Panel Usage

### Enable Admin Panel

- **In builds**: Set `VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN_PANEL=true` for the frontend
- **Local development**:
  ```bash
  export VITE_ENABLE_ADMIN_PANEL=true && docker compose up -d --build
  ```

### Using the Admin Panel

1. Log in as an admin user
2. Click the shield icon in the app header
3. The Admin Panel allows you to:
   - Toggle user's built-in `is_admin` flag
   - Assign or remove RBAC roles (`moderator`, `auditor`)
   - Load current roles for users
   - Enable/disable user registration

### Admin Settings

- **Registration toggle**: Enable/disable public sign-ups
  - Location: Admin Panel → User Management → "User Registration" switch
  - Persists in database (`app_settings.registration_enabled`)
  - On boot, backend seeds this from `ENABLE_REGISTRATION` if DB value doesn't exist

## Database User Management

### View All Users

```sql
-- List all users with basic info
SELECT
    id,
    email,
    COALESCE(is_admin, false) as is_admin,
    created_at,
    last_login,
    failed_attempts
FROM users
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

### Find Admin Users

```sql
-- List all admin users
SELECT
    id,
    email,
    created_at,
    last_login
FROM users
WHERE is_admin = true;
```

### User Activity Monitoring

```sql
-- Find inactive users (haven't logged in recently)
SELECT
    id,
    email,
    created_at,
    last_login,
    (NOW() - last_login) as inactive_period
FROM users
WHERE last_login < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
   OR last_login IS NULL;
```

### Account Security Management

```sql
-- Check users with too many failed attempts
SELECT
    id,
    email,
    failed_attempts,
    locked_until
FROM users
WHERE failed_attempts > 5;

-- Unlock a locked user account
UPDATE users
SET failed_attempts = 0,
    locked_until = NULL
WHERE email = 'user@example.com';
```

### User Statistics

```sql
-- Count total users
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM users;

-- Count active users (logged in last 30 days)
SELECT COUNT(*) as active_users
FROM users
WHERE last_login > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Count notes per user
SELECT
    u.email,
    COUNT(n.id) as note_count
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN workspaces w ON u.id = w.owner_id
LEFT JOIN notes n ON w.id = n.workspace_id
WHERE n.deleted_at IS NULL
GROUP BY u.id, u.email
ORDER BY note_count DESC;
```

## Security Considerations

### Zero-Knowledge Limitations

Due to the zero-knowledge architecture:
- **Admins cannot read user notes**: All content is encrypted with user keys
- **Password resets**: Must be handled carefully to maintain encryption
- **User data**: Only metadata (email, timestamps) is visible to admins

### Recommended Admin Capabilities

Safe admin operations that preserve encryption:
- ✅ View user list and metadata
- ✅ Monitor login attempts and security events
- ✅ Disable/enable user accounts
- ✅ View system statistics and usage
- ✅ Manage system-wide settings
- ❌ Read user notes or content
- ❌ Reset passwords without user involvement

## Database Administration

### Database Connection

```bash
# Using PostgreSQL command line
export PGPASSWORD="your-postgres-password"
psql -h localhost -U postgres -d notes

# Or connect via URL
# postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/notes
```

### Backup User Data

Before making changes, always backup:

```bash
# Backup users table
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d notes -t users > users_backup.sql

# Full database backup
pg_dump -h localhost -U postgres -d notes > full_backup.sql
```

## Common Admin Tasks

### Creating the First Admin

```sql
-- After first user registers, make them admin
UPDATE users
SET is_admin = true
WHERE email = (
    SELECT email FROM users
    ORDER BY created_at ASC
    LIMIT 1
);
```

### Emergency Account Recovery

```sql
-- If admin is locked out, unlock manually
UPDATE users
SET failed_attempts = 0,
    locked_until = NULL
WHERE is_admin = true;
```

### System Maintenance

```sql
-- Clean up old deleted notes (after 30 days)
DELETE FROM notes
WHERE deleted_at IS NOT NULL
  AND deleted_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## Monitoring and Logging

For production admin management:

1. **Enable PostgreSQL logging** for audit trails
2. **Monitor authentication failures** for security
3. **Set up alerts** for suspicious activity
4. **Regular backups** of user data

## Security Notes

- Admin endpoints require valid JWT and admin role; UI gating is convenience only
- Do not expose `ADMIN_USER_IDS` in production images
- Manage admin status through database and role assignment flows in production
- All admin operations respect the encryption model and user privacy principles
