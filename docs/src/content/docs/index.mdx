## Quick Start

LeafLock is a secure notes application with end-to-end encryption, featuring a Go backend with Fiber framework and a React TypeScript frontend. The application uses PostgreSQL for data storage, Redis for session management, and implements zero-knowledge architecture where the server never sees plaintext data.

### Key Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All note content is encrypted client-side using XChaCha20-Poly1305
- **Zero-Knowledge Architecture**: Server never sees plaintext data  
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Go backend, React frontend, PostgreSQL database
- **Production Ready**: Docker support, monitoring, and backup capabilities
