# Managing Your MFA Settings

This guide covers how to manage your Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) after you've enabled it.

## Accessing MFA Settings

1. Log in to your LeafLock account
2. Click on **Settings** or your profile icon
3. Navigate to **Security** → **Multi-Factor Authentication**

You'll see your current MFA status and management options.

## Disabling MFA

If you need to disable two-factor authentication:

### Security Warning

Disabling MFA makes your account less secure. You'll only need your password to sign in, which is less protected than MFA. Only disable if absolutely necessary.

### Step-by-Step: Disable MFA

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security** → **MFA**
2. Click the **Disable MFA** button
3. You'll be prompted to enter a verification code
4. Open your authenticator app
5. Enter the current 6-digit code for LeafLock
6. Click **Disable MFA**

### What Happens After Disabling

When you disable MFA:
- You can log in with just your email and password
- Your TOTP secret is deleted
- All backup codes are invalidated and deleted
- Your account is less secure

### Can't Access Your Authenticator?

If you can't get a code from your authenticator app:
1. Use a [backup code](/authentication/backup-codes) instead
2. Or contact your administrator for [MFA reset](/authentication/admin-mfa-management)

## Regenerating Backup Codes

Backup codes are one-time use codes for emergency access. You should regenerate them periodically or when needed.

### When to Regenerate

Consider regenerating backup codes when:
- You've used more than 7 of your 10 codes
- You suspect codes may have been compromised
- You want to refresh your security (every 6-12 months)
- You've shared a code (not recommended, but it happens)

### Step-by-Step: Regenerate Backup Codes

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security** → **MFA**
2. In the **Backup Recovery Codes** section, click **Regenerate Backup Codes**
3. Enter your **password** to confirm (not your TOTP code)
4. Click **Generate New Codes**
5. You'll see 10 new backup codes
6. **Important**: Download or copy these codes immediately
7. Store them securely (password manager, encrypted storage)
8. Click **I've Saved My Backup Codes**

### Important Notes

- **Old codes are invalidated**: All previous backup codes (including unused ones) stop working immediately
- **No recovery**: You cannot view backup codes after this screen closes
- **Password required**: You need your account password, not a TOTP code

### Storing Your New Codes

**Recommended storage locations**:
- Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass)
- Encrypted note-taking app
- Physical paper in a secure location

**DO NOT store in**:
- Unencrypted text files
- Email or unencrypted cloud storage
- Shared documents

## Checking Backup Code Status

You can check how many backup codes you have remaining without viewing the actual codes.

### View Backup Code Status

1. Go to **Settings** → **Security** → **MFA**
2. Click **View Backup Code Status**
3. You'll see:
   - **Total codes**: 10 (always)
   - **Remaining codes**: Number of unused codes
   - **Used codes**: Number already consumed

### Understanding the Numbers

| Remaining | Status | Recommendation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| 10 | All codes available | No action needed |
| 7-9 | A few codes used | Still plenty |
| 4-6 | Half used | Consider regenerating soon |
| 1-3 | Running low | Regenerate backup codes |
| 0 | All codes used | Regenerate immediately |

### If You Run Out of Backup Codes

- You can still log in with your authenticator app (no problem)
- But you have **no emergency backup** if you lose your device
- **Immediately regenerate** new codes after logging in

## MFA Lifecycle Management

### The Complete MFA Journey

```
Enable MFA
    ↓
Save Backup Codes
    ↓
Use MFA Daily (authenticator app)
    ↓
Monitor Backup Code Usage
    ↓
Regenerate Codes (when needed)
    ↓
Continue Using MFA
```

### Best Practices for Ongoing Use

#### Daily Usage
1. Keep your authenticator app installed and backed up
2. Use TOTP codes (not backup codes) for normal logins
3. Ensure your device clock is accurate (for TOTP)

#### Regular Maintenance
1. Check backup code status monthly
2. Regenerate codes if you've used more than 6
3. Update your stored codes after regenerating

#### Device Management
1. Set up MFA on multiple devices (if your authenticator supports it)
2. Keep backup codes accessible but secure
3. Update MFA if you get a new phone

## Switching to a New Device

If you're getting a new phone or tablet:

### Option 1: Transfer Authenticator App (Recommended)

Most authenticator apps support cloud backup or transfer:

**Google Authenticator**:
1. On old device: Settings → Transfer accounts → Export accounts
2. Scan QR code with new device
3. Verify MFA still works

**Authy**:
- Automatically syncs across devices with your Authy account

**1Password/Bitwarden**:
- Syncs automatically to all devices

### Option 2: Re-setup MFA

If you can't transfer:
1. Log in on your computer (using your authenticator app from old device)
2. Disable MFA (using old device for verification)
3. Enable MFA again (scan QR with new device)
4. Save new backup codes

### Option 3: Use Backup Code (Emergency)

If you already lost your old device:
1. Log in with email and password
2. Use a backup code when prompted for MFA
3. After logging in, disable MFA
4. Re-enable MFA with your new device
5. Generate and save new backup codes

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Invalid code" when trying to disable MFA

**Possible causes**:
- Time synchronization issue
- Looking at wrong account in authenticator
- Code expired (30-second window)

**Solutions**:
1. Check device time is accurate (enable auto-sync)
2. Wait for a new code to generate
3. Verify you're using the LeafLock entry in your app

### Can't regenerate backup codes

**Cause**: Wrong password entered

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're entering your **account password**, not a TOTP code
- Check caps lock is off
- Try resetting your password if you've forgotten it

### Lost both authenticator and backup codes

**Solution**: Contact your system administrator
- See [Admin MFA Management](/authentication/admin-mfa-management) for reset procedures
- You'll need to verify your identity
- Admin can reset MFA, allowing password-only login
- Re-enable MFA immediately after regaining access

---

## Security Recommendations

### Best Practices

- Keep your authenticator app backed up (if supported)
- Store backup codes in a password manager
- Use MFA on all accounts that support it
- Keep one physical backup of codes in a secure location
- Regenerate codes periodically
- Use strong, unique password alongside MFA

### What to Avoid

- Never share your TOTP codes with anyone
- Don't take screenshots of backup codes
- Don't store codes in unencrypted cloud storage
- Don't use the same password on multiple sites
- Don't disable MFA unless absolutely necessary
- Don't ignore low backup code warnings
