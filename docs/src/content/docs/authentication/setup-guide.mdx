# Multi-Factor Authentication Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA/MFA) on your LeafLock account.

## Prerequisites

- An active LeafLock account
- A smartphone or tablet
- An authenticator app installed (see [supported apps](/authentication#supported-authenticator-apps))

## Step 1: Access Security Settings

1. Log in to your LeafLock account
2. Click on your profile icon or settings gear
3. Navigate to **Settings** → **Security** → **Multi-Factor Authentication**

## Step 2: Begin MFA Setup

1. Click the **Enable MFA** button
2. You'll be presented with a QR code and a text secret

## Step 3: Scan QR Code

### Using Your Authenticator App:

1. Open your authenticator app
2. Tap the **+** or **Add** button
3. Select **Scan QR Code** or **Scan Barcode**
4. Point your camera at the QR code on screen
5. The app will automatically add a LeafLock entry

### Alternative: Manual Entry

If you can't scan the QR code:

1. In your authenticator app, select **Enter a setup key** or **Manual entry**
2. Enter the following details:
   - **Account name**: Your email address
   - **Secret key**: The text code shown below the QR code
   - **Type of key**: Time-based
3. Save the entry

## Step 4: Verify Your Code

1. Your authenticator app will display a 6-digit code
2. Enter this code in the verification field on LeafLock
3. Click **Verify & Enable**

## Step 5: Save Backup Codes

**IMPORTANT:** After verification, you'll be shown 10 backup recovery codes.

### What to Do:

1. **Download** the codes as a text file, or
2. **Copy** the codes to a secure location

### Where to Store Backup Codes:

**Recommended storage locations:**
- Password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
- Encrypted note-taking app
- Physical paper in a secure location (safe, lockbox)

**Not recommended:**
- Unencrypted text file on your computer
- Email or cloud storage without encryption
- Shared documents

### Backup Code Format:
```
A1B2-C3D4-E5F6-G7H8
I9J0-K1L2-M3N4-O5P6
...
```

Each code is 16 characters and can only be used **once**.

## Step 6: Complete Setup

1. Check the box confirming you've saved your backup codes
2. Click **I've Saved My Backup Codes**
3. MFA is now enabled

## Logging In with MFA

From now on, when you log in:

1. Enter your email and password
2. You'll be prompted for your 6-digit MFA code
3. Open your authenticator app
4. Enter the current code for LeafLock
5. Click **Verify**

### Using a Backup Code

If you don't have access to your authenticator app:

1. On the MFA verification screen, click **Use Backup Code Instead**
2. Enter one of your backup recovery codes
3. Click **Verify Backup Code**

**Note**: Each backup code can only be used once. After using one, you'll have one less code available.

## Testing Your Setup

It's recommended to test MFA before fully relying on it:

1. While still logged in, open an incognito/private browser window
2. Try logging in to verify MFA works correctly
3. Test both authenticator code and a backup code

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid MFA code" error
- Ensure your device's clock is accurate (TOTP requires time synchronization)
- Wait for a new code to generate (codes expire every 30 seconds)
- Check that you're looking at the correct account in your authenticator app

### Can't scan QR code
- Try increasing screen brightness
- Use manual entry instead (see Step 3)
- Try a different authenticator app

### Lost access to authenticator app
- Use a backup code to log in
- Consider setting up MFA on a new device
- Generate new backup codes from security settings
