# MFA Troubleshooting Guide

Common issues and solutions for Multi-Factor Authentication.

## "Invalid MFA code" Error

### Cause
- Time synchronization issue between device and server
- Code has expired (30-second window)
- Wrong account in authenticator app

### Solutions
1. **Check device time**:
   - Ensure automatic date & time is enabled
   - Sync time with internet time server
   - Verify timezone is correct

2. **Wait for new code**:
   - TOTP codes expire every 30 seconds
   - Wait for the authenticator to generate a new code

3. **Verify correct account**:
   - Check you're viewing the LeafLock entry
   - Account name should match your email

## Can't Scan QR Code

### Solutions
1. Increase screen brightness
2. Move camera closer or further away
3. Clean camera lens
4. Use manual entry instead:
   - Copy the text secret
   - Open authenticator app
   - Select "Enter a setup key"
   - Paste the secret

## Lost Authenticator Device

### If you have backup codes:
1. Log in using a backup code
2. Disable MFA
3. Set up MFA on new device
4. Generate new backup codes

### If you don't have backup codes:
- Contact your administrator for MFA reset
- See [Admin MFA Management](/authentication/admin-mfa-management)

## Rate Limited ("Too many attempts")

### Cause
Exceeded maximum failed verification attempts

### Wait times:
- 5 failed TOTP attempts: 15-minute lockout
- 3 failed backup codes: 15-minute lockout

### Solution
Wait for the lockout period to expire, then try again with correct code.

## Backup Code Not Working

### Check:
1. Code format: `XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX` (16 characters)
2. Code not previously used (one-time use only)
3. Codes not regenerated (old codes invalidated)
