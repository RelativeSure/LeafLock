# Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

LeafLock implements Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) multi-factor authentication to provide an additional layer of security for your account.

## What is MFA?

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requires two forms of verification to access your account:
1. **Something you know** - Your password
2. **Something you have** - Your authentication device (phone/tablet with authenticator app)

Even if someone obtains your password, they cannot access your account without the second factor.

## Features

- **TOTP-based authentication** compatible with all major authenticator apps
- **Backup recovery codes** for emergency access
- **QR code setup** for easy configuration
- **Rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
- **Audit logging** of all MFA events

## Supported Authenticator Apps

LeafLock's MFA works with any TOTP-compatible authenticator app:

- **Google Authenticator** (iOS, Android)
- **Authy** (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- **Microsoft Authenticator** (iOS, Android)
- **1Password** (with TOTP support)
- **Bitwarden** (with premium)
- **Any RFC 6238 compliant TOTP app**

## Security Model

### TOTP Configuration
- **Algorithm**: SHA-1 (industry standard)
- **Time step**: 30 seconds
- **Code length**: 6 digits
- **Secret storage**: Encrypted with server encryption key

### Backup Codes
- **Count**: 10 codes per user
- **Format**: 16 characters (XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX)
- **Storage**: Argon2id hashed (cannot be retrieved in plaintext)
- **Usage**: One-time use only
- **Regeneration**: Available anytime with password confirmation

### Rate Limiting
- **TOTP verification**: 5 attempts per 15 minutes per user
- **Backup code verification**: 3 attempts per 15 minutes per user
- **Implementation**: Redis-based rate limiting
