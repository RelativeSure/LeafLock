This replaces the old "report" style page with something you can actually use. Walk the list before going live and tick the boxes inside your preferred tracker.

## Core Services

- [ ] PostgreSQL, Redis, backend, and frontend containers are healthy (`docker compose ps` or provider UI)
- [ ] `/api/v1/health` returns `"status": "healthy"`
- [ ] Admin user exists and you can sign in

## Configuration

- [ ] `JWT_SECRET` and `SERVER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` generated from a secure source
- [ ] `CORS_ORIGINS` and `VITE_API_URL` match the public domain
- [ ] `ENABLE_REGISTRATION` is set the way you expect (defaults to `false`)
- [ ] Backups or snapshots configured for PostgreSQL and Redis data

## Security

- [ ] HTTPS enabled end to end (certificate issued or managed by your platform)
- [ ] Security headers validated (check with `curl -I` or securityheaders.com)
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled on the backend (default configuration ships enabled)
- [ ] Admin accounts protected with MFA where available

## Monitoring & Logs

- [ ] Logs flowing to the platform dashboard or your log aggregator
- [ ] Optional metrics endpoint enabled if you plan to scrape Prometheus (`ENABLE_METRICS=true`)
- [ ] Alerting configured for downtime or error spikes

## Final Smoke Test

- [ ] Create, edit, and delete an encrypted note via the UI
- [ ] Trigger password reset and verify the email flow (if applicable)
- [ ] Perform a redeploy to ensure environment variables survive restarts

If something fails, jump to the relevant deployment page or the [Troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting/). Keep the checklist short and factual so it never turns into busywork.
