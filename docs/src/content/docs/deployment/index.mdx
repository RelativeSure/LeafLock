title: Deployment Overview
description: Choose the right LeafLock hosting option and jump straight to the guide you need.
---

LeafLock can run on any Docker-capable platform. Pick the option that matches the way you ship software and follow the linked guide. Everything else in this section stays lean so you do not have to read the same advice twice.

## Platform Snapshot

| Platform | Best For | Why Choose It |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Railway](./railway/) | Fastest path to a hosted instance | Git-based deploys, zero infrastructure maintenance |
| [Coolify](./coolify/) | Self-hosted control with a UI | Bring-your-own server, Docker Compose stays first-class |
| [Docker Compose](./docker/) | Local or custom servers | Full control, easy to integrate with existing stacks |
| [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/) | Enterprises and complex scaling | Works with any cluster, fits GitOps/Argo workflows |

## Quick Starts

- Need a production environment today? Follow the [Railway guide](./railway/).
- Running your own hardware? Jump to the [Coolify guide](./coolify/).
- Building bespoke infrastructure? Start with the [Docker Compose](./docker/) instructions, then adapt.
- Already have a cluster? Go straight to [Kubernetes](./kubernetes/).

## Before You Deploy

All platforms share the same requirements:

- Generate `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `JWT_SECRET`, and `SERVER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` with `openssl rand`
- Point `CORS_ORIGINS` and `VITE_API_URL` at the URL your users will hit
- Keep `ENABLE_REGISTRATION=false` unless you want public sign-ups on day one
- Expose `8080` for the backend and `80` (or your chosen ingress) for the frontend

Keep the [Reference page](/reference/) open for variable names, ports, and health endpoints.

## After Deploying

- Walk through the short [Deployment Readiness Checklist](./deployment-readiness/)
- Hit `/api/v1/health` and verify the UI can create an encrypted note
- Rotate secrets and reboot once to prove everything survives restarts

## Need Help?

Head to [Troubleshooting](/troubleshooting/) for platform-specific fixes (starting with Railway), or open a GitHub issue if something new breaks. The goal is to keep each document focused so you spend time shipping, not reading.
